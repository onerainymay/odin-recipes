        <h3>Comfort in a Mug</h3>

        <p>Heading to the kitchen and being greeted by the smell of a hot pot of chai is like a hug for the senses (yes, this is an attempt at trying to be poetic but you gotta believe me on this one). This doodh chai recipe is the same one I've grown up drinking and continue to make. The recipe is simple, but makes the perfect cup each time. Even though your chai will never be as good as my mom's, this foolproof recipe will surely yield you with the perfect drink to warm you up on a cold, rainy day!</p>
