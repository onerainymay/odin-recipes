        <h3>The Perfect, Mellow Latte</h3>
        <p>Also known as a London Fog, this drink is soothing, fragrant, and pairs well with a pastry (or two!)</p>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>       
        <ul>
            <li>1 earl grey tea bag</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey (or to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill your mug up a quarter way (about 2 oz) with water and microwave for 1 minute</li>
            <li>Add the teabag and honey, stir to mix and let sit covered for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>In the meantime, add milk to a saucepan over medium heat to warm up, and whisk continuously as it warms to create froth (this can also be done in a frother or french press, if one has one)</li>
            <li>Remove the teabag and pour the milk, hold the froth to the side so you can pour it on top last</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
